Project : Regional Meteorology and Advanced Weather Forecast App  

App : 

Complexity level : intermediate

what is it ?

an app with Advanced weather forecast and Meteorology detection based on a region 
using a  gui toolkit @tkinter and @Open-Weather-API that provides realtime predictions based on complex mathematical predictions models

what are its features ?

+ interactive UI based region detection
+ time , region and coordiante display
+ temprature 
+ humidity
+ pressure
+ windspeed 
+ description of sky pattern 
+ prediction of temperature maxima and minima for 24 hrs 
+ prediction of weather for next  6 days 


how its implemented ?

-- input city  
-- city is converted to longitude and latitude
-- coordinates is converted into time zone and clock
-- coordinates is relayed to Open Weather API that provides realtime data 
-- this data is send backed to the app and all features are displayed
